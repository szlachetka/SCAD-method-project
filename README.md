Performance of BIC and GCV for the SCAD penalty on Least Squares Regression

Applied tuning parameter selectors (BIC, generalized cross validation) for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty on least squares estimation. 
Simulations were conducted in R, and the process of obtaining the tuning parameter using BIC through minimization was also manually coded from the ground up. 
Through comparison of model error and number of correct predictors selected, BIC outperforms GCV due to its consistency.
Simulations are based of off population data provided by the following article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663963/
